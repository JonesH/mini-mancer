# Mini-Mancer Repository Analysis - Exact Operational Semantics

## Architecture Overview
Mini-Mancer is a sophisticated AI bot creation platform integrating:
- **OpenServ** (external workflow API via FastAPI)  
- **Agno** (core AI framework using OpenAI GPT models)
- **Telegram** (bot deployment via python-telegram-bot)

## Core Operational Flow

### 1. **Dual Server Architecture** (`main.py`)
- **FastAPI Server** (port 14159): OpenServ integration endpoints
- **Telegram Polling**: Factory bot (BotMother) message handling
- Concurrent execution via `asyncio.gather()`
- Environment-based token management:
  - Factory: `BOT_MOTHER_TOKEN` → `BOT_TOKEN` → `TEST_BOT_TOKEN`  
  - Created bots: `BOT_TOKEN_1` (with fallback support)

### 2. **Bot Creation Semantics**
**Two Creation Modes:**
- **Instant Mode**: Quick bot creation via `create_new_bot_instant()`
- **Architect Mode**: Sophisticated creation via `create_new_bot_advanced()` with requirements gathering

**Dual Bot System:**
- **Factory Bot**: BotMother personality creates other bots
- **Created Bot**: User-designed bot with independent polling application

### 3. **Intelligence Layer Architecture**

**AgentDNA System** (`src/models/agent_dna.py`):
- Core blueprint with identity, personality traits, behavioral patterns
- Enhanced personality system (communication style, quirks, response patterns)
- Auto-generates comprehensive system prompts from DNA structure

**BotMother AI** (`src/prompts/botmother_prompts.py`):
- Sophisticated factory bot personality with dual creation modes
- Requirements gathering interview process
- Advanced reasoning integration via thinking tools

**Quality Assurance Pipeline** (`src/bot_compilation_pipeline.py`):
- Multi-stage async compilation: validation → generation → testing → optimization → deployment
- Automated test case generation based on requirements and use cases
- Multi-dimensional scoring (personality, capability, response quality)
- OpenServ workflow integration for complex bots

### 4. **Platform Integration Semantics**

**TelegramBotTemplate** (`src/agents/telegram_bot_template.py`):
- Platform wrapper around AgentDNA
- Independent conversation contexts per user
- Capability-based message routing (text, photos, documents)

**OpenServ Integration** (`src/prototype_agent.py`):
- RESTful API for external workflow integration
- Bot compilation status tracking with progress reporting
- Health checks and tool availability endpoints
- Structured request/response models

### 5. **Key Operational Patterns**

**Concurrent Bot Lifecycle:**
1. Factory bot handles user requests
2. Requirements gathering (instant or architect mode)  
3. AgentDNA generation from requirements
4. TelegramBotTemplate instantiation
5. Independent polling application creation
6. Autonomous bot operation

**Quality Assurance Integration:**
- Requirements validation with 0-100 scoring system
- Test scenario generation from use cases and personality traits
- Automated testing against generated scenarios
- Optimization feedback loop

**Advanced Reasoning:**
- Thinking tool integration for complex decision-making
- Structured analysis for requirements and bot architecture
- Creative ideation and problem-solving frameworks

## Data Flow Architecture

### Bot Creation Flow
```
User Request → BotMother → Requirements Gathering → AgentDNA Generation
     ↓
Validation → TelegramBotTemplate → Independent Polling → Live Bot
```

### OpenServ Integration Flow
```
External System → FastAPI Endpoints → Agno Processing → Response
                      ↑
                 Bot Compilation Pipeline
```

### Quality Assurance Flow
```
Requirements → Validation → Test Generation → Bot Testing → Scoring → Optimization
```
